# GitHub Setup Instructions

## To complete the GitHub setup, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
- Go to https://github.com
- Click "New repository"
- Name it something like "EmployeeApplication-Enhanced"
- Make it public or private as you prefer
- Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Add the remote origin
Run this command in your terminal, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify the push
- Go to your GitHub repository
- You should see all the files including:
  - The enhanced UserInformation model
  - New Identity pages (Register, Login, Logout)
  - Profile functionality
  - Database migration
  - README.md with documentation

## What's been implemented:

✅ **Enhanced User Model**: Added FirstName, Qualification, and Module fields
✅ **Custom Registration**: Collects all required user information
✅ **Database Migration**: Updated database schema
✅ **Profile View**: Shows user information after login
✅ **Simple Design**: Basic Bootstrap styling suitable for learning
✅ **Documentation**: Clear README explaining all changes
✅ **Git Setup**: Local repository initialized and committed

## Next Steps:
1. Follow the GitHub setup instructions above
2. Test the application by running `dotnet run`
3. Navigate to `/Identity/Account/Register` to test registration
4. Test login and profile viewing functionality

The application is now ready with an enhanced Identity system that collects and stores Qualification and Module information for each user!
